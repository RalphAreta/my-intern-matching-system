## Internship Recommendation System

Hybrid desktop recommender that combines Apriori-based collaborative filtering with a supervised ranking model to highlight the most suitable internship opportunities for a user-provided skillset.

### Key Features
- **Two-stage intelligence**
  - Apriori collaborative filtering mines frequent skillsets and association rules.
  - A supervised Random Forest ranking model scores suitability using engineered features (matched/missing skills, cosine similarity, CF frequency score, company/title popularity, etc.).
- **Tkinter desktop UI**
  - Skill textbox + `Train Models`, `Recommend Internships`, `Clear` buttons.
  - Table view with `Internship Title`, `Company`, `CF Score`, `Confidence Score`, `Matched Skills`, `Missing Skills`.
  - Detail panel that explains required/preferred skills, final score, and experience requirements.
- **Model persistence**
  - Pickled artifacts stored in `models/cf_apriori.pkl` and `models/ranking_model.pkl` to avoid retraining on every launch.
  - Training can be triggered anytime via the GUI button for fresh data.
- **PyInstaller-ready**
  - Relative path helpers support both source execution and frozen `.exe` builds.
  - `build_exe.bat` wraps the recommended PyInstaller command.

### Getting Started
**IMPORANT:** Python: 3.12 (or 3.11) with Tcl/Tk installed (the default from python.org with “tcl/tk and IDLE” checked).
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # On Windows PowerShell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the desktop app**
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```
3. **Workflow**
   1. Click **Train Models** (first run) – builds the Apriori CF model and supervised ranking model.
   2. Enter comma-separated skills (e.g., `python, react, sql, flask`).
   3. Click **Recommend Internships** to view the top 5 matches, their hybrid scores, and matched vs. missing skills.
   4. Use **Clear** to reset the UI.

### Modeling Details
#### Collaborative Filtering (Apriori)
- Transactions: internship required skill lists.
- Apriori configuration: `min_support=0.05`, `metric='lift'`.
- CF score for a user/internship pair = sum of lifts where user skills satisfy antecedents and internship skills satisfy consequents (with a matched-skill fallback).
- Frequency score captures how common each skill is across internships.

#### Supervised Ranking
- Features: matched/missing counts, cosine similarity, CF score, required/preferred counts, frequency score, company/title popularity.
- Model: `RandomForestRegressor` (200 estimators, n_jobs=-1).
- Labels autogenerated from resume/internship overlap (>=60 % coverage ⇒ positive class).
- Final score: `0.5 * normalized_cf_score + 0.5 * ranking_score`.

### Building a Windows Executable
1. Ensure dependencies are installed.
2. Run the helper script:
   ```bash
   build_exe.bat
   ```
   This installs PyInstaller if needed and executes:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile app\main.py
   ```
3. The resulting `.exe` appears in `dist/`. Keep the `datasets/` folder beside the executable, or embed data via the script’s `--add-data` directives.

### Tips & Notes
- Model artifacts default to `models/` in the current working directory (created automatically). Delete them to force a clean retrain.
- When running the packaged `.exe`, datasets can live either next to the executable or inside the bundled resources (automatically detected).
- The GUI uses background threads for long-running operations and marshals UI updates back to the Tkinter main thread.
- Training may take ~1–2 minutes depending on hardware (≈1000 resumes × 1000 internships → capped at 30 samples per resume).

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing datasets**: ensure `datasets/resume_dataset_1000.csv` and `datasets/internship_requirements_1000.csv` exist (case-sensitive).
- **Model pickle errors**: delete the `models/` directory and retrain from the GUI (or run a CLI helper, if desired).
- **PyInstaller path issues**: the utility loader first checks the working directory, then the bundled resources; copying `datasets/` alongside the `.exe` usually resolves path errors.
